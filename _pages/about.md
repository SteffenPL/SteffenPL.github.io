This page is about my research in [Sara Merino-Aceituno's kinetic theory group](https://saramerinoaceituno.wordpress.com/).

My research interests are:
- kinetic theory (and applications in biology)
  - epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transition in the chick neural tube
  - vertex models
  - coupling between microscopic and macroscopic systems
  - stochastic evolution equations
- scientific computing
  - geometric numerical methods (sympectic methods, FEEC...)
  - elasticity
