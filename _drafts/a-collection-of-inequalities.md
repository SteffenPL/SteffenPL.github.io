title: Searching mathematical inequalities

---
Mathematical inequalities and estimates are essential for rigorous numerics and analysis. Almost every branch of mathematics brings its own set of essential inequalities which contributes to a vast collection.   
  
However, if one needs a particular inequality, it is often incredibly hard to find the right ones.

I decided to make an over of inequalities that are useful for my research.

#### Basic analysis

#### Combinatorics

#### Differential equations
