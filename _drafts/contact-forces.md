A few days ago, I noticed that there are many sources to solve equations like this

$$  
\\dot x = f(x) - \\lambda \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} \\quad \\text{with} \\quad g(x) = 0,  
$$

but far less literatur for problem like

$$  
\\dot x = f(x) - \\lambda \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} \\quad \\text{with} \\quad g(x) = 0,  
$$
